# Kraken/Ansible

For most modern systems, configuration management should be the ultimate source of truth for configuration information for a system.  To that end, we provide some ansible roles that can control Kraken.

The ansible roles in this directory serve two purposes:

1. To provide a template for anyone wishing to develop ansible management for a Kraken-based system;
2. To provide ansible to be used in the kraken examples.
